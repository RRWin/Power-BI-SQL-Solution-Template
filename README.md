###Introduction

The SQL Server template sets up a solution that pulls sample Sales data from SQL Server 2016 and populates this into a Power BI desktop report.
Users can then use this pre-built Power BI report(s) that leverage Microsoft research technology to start analyzing the Sample Sales data from MS World Wide Importers DW.
It is also possible to augment it with additional data sources.
The template is aimed as a proof of concept for creating a working solution template with active connections (customizable), that should help leverage the Power BI portfolio at WinWire Technologies.

This document provides  a walkthrough of the sample SQL Solution Template and overview of the different customization possibilities.
